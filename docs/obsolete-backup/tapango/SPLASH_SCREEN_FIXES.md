# TAPANGO Splash Screen Fixes & Improvements

## 🐛 Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. Navigation Stuck Issue

**Problem**: Splash screen was stuck and not navigating to onboarding **Root
Causes**:

- Root layout was calling `SplashScreen.hideAsync()` after 300ms, conflicting
  with splash screen timing
- Complex authentication logic causing navigation loops
- Waiting for Clerk to load was causing delays

**Solutions**:

- Removed `SplashScreen.hideAsync()` from root layout (`_layout.tsx`)
- Simplified navigation logic to always show onboarding first
- Fixed timing to ensure 5-second consistent display
- Added fallback navigation to onboarding for safety

### 2. Circle Container Around Lottie Animation

**Problem**: Lottie animation was wrapped in a circular container with borders
**Solution**:

- Removed `logoIconContainer` wrapper with circle styling
- Added `lottieAnimationLarge` style for bigger direct Lottie display
- Increased animation size from 80x80 to 200x200 pixels

### 3. Timing Inconsistencies

**Problem**: Splash screen timing was inconsistent (preparation + additional
delays) **Solution**:

- Adjusted loading states to total ~4 seconds
- Reduced final delay to 1 second for UI rendering
- Total consistent display time: 5 seconds

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### `/app/splash.tsx`

```typescript
// Fixed navigation logic
const handleSplashComplete = async () => {
  // Simplified: Always check onboarding first
  const onboardingCompleted = await StorageService.getOnboardingCompleted();

  if (!onboardingCompleted) {
    router.replace('/onboarding');
    return;
  }
  // Then handle authentication...
};

// Removed circle container
<LottieView
  source={SplashAnimation}
  autoPlay
  loop
  style={styles.lottieAnimationLarge} // 200x200 instead of 80x80
  resizeMode="contain"
  speed={0.8}
/>
```

### `/app/_layout.tsx`

```typescript
// Removed conflicting splash screen hiding
// Note: splash screen hiding is controlled by the splash.tsx screen
// Do not call SplashScreen.hideAsync() here
```

### Timing Adjustments

- Loading states: 1000ms + 1500ms + 1500ms = 4 seconds
- Final UI render delay: 1 second
- **Total display time: 5 seconds**

## 🎯 Expected User Flow

1. **App Launch** → Native splash screen
2. **Custom Splash** (5 seconds) → Lottie animation + loading states
3. **Navigation Decision**:
   - If onboarding not completed → `/onboarding`
   - If onboarding completed & authenticated → `/(tabs)`
   - If onboarding completed & not authenticated → `/(auth)/sign-in`

## 🎨 Visual Improvements

### Before

- Small 80x80 Lottie animation in circular container
- Complex timing with potential delays
- Debug buttons visible (removed in production)

### After

- Large 200x200 Lottie animation without container
- Consistent 5-second display time
- Clean production build without debug elements
- Smooth entrance animations with React Native Reanimated

## 📱 Testing Instructions

### To Test Onboarding Flow:

1. **Clear app data** on device/simulator
2. **Launch app** and observe:
   - Splash screen displays for exactly 5 seconds
   - Large Lottie animation without circle
   - Loading text progresses through states
   - Automatically navigates to onboarding

### Expected Console Logs:

```
🚀 App starting - redirecting to splash screen
⏰ Splash screen loading completed
🎯 Splash complete - navigating to onboarding
📊 Onboarding status check: { onboardingCompleted: false, ... }
🎆 Showing onboarding screens
```

## 🎪 Animation Enhancements

### Splash Screen Animations

- **Logo Scale**: Bounce effect with spring physics (0 → 1.2 → 1)
- **Fade In**: Staggered opacity animations (logo → text)
- **Loading Indicator**: Smooth spinner with contextual text

### Lottie Configuration

```typescript
<LottieView
  source={SplashAnimation}
  autoPlay
  loop
  style={styles.lottieAnimationLarge}
  resizeMode="contain"
  speed={0.8}
/>
```

## 🔍 Performance Considerations

- **Memory**: Removed unnecessary container views
- **Timing**: Predictable 5-second display prevents user confusion
- **Animation**: Hardware-accelerated Reanimated for smooth performance
- **Navigation**: Direct routing prevents navigation loops

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** on both iOS and Android
2. **Verify Lottie animations** load correctly from assets
3. **Check onboarding flow** completes properly
4. **Validate authentication** routing after onboarding
5. **Performance test** on lower-end devices

The splash screen now provides a professional, consistent experience that
properly leads users into the onboarding flow after exactly 5 seconds, with a
beautiful large Lottie animation and smooth transitions.
