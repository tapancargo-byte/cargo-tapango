# Obsolete Documentation Archive

This directory contains documentation files that have been consolidated into the main `DOCUMENTATION.md` file at the repository root.

## What's Here

- **tapango/**: Mobile app documentation files
- **admin/**: Admin dashboard documentation files  
- Historical README files, setup guides, and feature documentation
- Status reports and migration guides
- Design documentation and technical specifications

## Why Were These Moved?

These files were moved during the repository cleanup process (September 2025) to:

1. **Reduce Documentation Fragmentation**: Instead of 50+ scattered markdown files, we now have a single comprehensive `DOCUMENTATION.md`
2. **Improve Developer Experience**: New developers can find everything in one place
3. **Maintain Historical Reference**: These files are preserved for reference but not actively maintained

## Current Documentation

For current, up-to-date documentation, see:
- **`/DOCUMENTATION.md`** - Comprehensive project documentation
- **`/WARP.md`** - WARP-specific guidance
- **`/README.md`** - Project overview and quick start

## Restoration

If you need to restore any of these files:

```bash
# Copy file back to original location
cp docs/obsolete-backup/path/to/file.md path/to/restore/location/

# Or view content directly
cat docs/obsolete-backup/path/to/file.md
```
